## Introduction

_Start off by setting the stage for your project. Give a brief overview of relevant studies or work that have tackled similar issues. Then, clearly describe the main question or problem your project is designed to solve._

How do you say it?
Recent studies in the realm of the political sciences have shown a shift in the rethoric of politicians. They propose that the current dissemination of misinformation in political discourse is linked to an "alternative understanding of truth and honesty that emphasizes invocation of subjective belief at the expense of reliance on evidence" [Source-2]. This can be seen and measured through the language that politicians use.
As social media is cited as a key medium for spreading misinformation [Source-2], it is interesting to have a look, not only *wwat* kind of information is spread, but also *how?*.

### Evidence minus Intuition (EMI)

To answer that question we employ the EMI-Score. The Evidence-minus-Intuition measure was created in the context of US congressional speeches and the communication of politicians. It aims to capture how much of their language is "evidence-based" opposed to "intuition-based" to give insight into their approach to honesty and truthfulness [Source-1]. "Evidence-based" reasoning apporaches truth "by relying on evidence, facts, data and other elements of external reality" [Source-1] whereas the "intuition-based" approach relies "on feelings, instincts, personal values and other elements drawn mainly from a personâ€™s internal experiences." in its conception of truth [Source-1]. 
The EMI is not concerned with the actual truth value of the content it is applied on but only considers the rhetoric. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the actual quality of posts. But we assume that the concept can be transferred from political speech to the diverse content of Reddit forums - the social-media data to be analyzed -  and can be employed to gain insight about the present language.

Our research quest is to show that the EMI can be applied to the domain of social-media and to find out how language is used in different subreddits.

### Hypotheses

The data employed are Reddit posts from different subreddits, subforums on the platform. We expect some to have more evidence based language and other to rely more on intuition in how contents are discussed.

### Roadmap

After preprocessing we calculated the EMI score for subreddits, posts and individual words. To do this we followed the approach of the authors of the EMI score, as described in their paper from 2024 [Source-1]. The results were visually explored in histograms, wordclouds and PCA.

To validate our findings and test them for their robustness we conducted several "experiments" changing different settings of the approach. As a first experiment we compared the EMI scores for the long-posts with those of the corresponding summaries. Secondly we followed the process described by the authors and constructed and applied our own dictionary and thus a vocabulary definition of evidence resp. intuition based on the language used in the reddit forums. Lastly we experimented with a different embedding / latent representation by applying BERT instead of the word2vec algorithm/method (XX) to the long posts.

## Dataset

_Provide a short description of the dataset used in your project. Focus on highlighting the aspects that are particularly relevant to your work._

XX - available on Huggingface [Source-4]

The dataset contains Reddit subreddit posts containing "TL;DR" from 2006 to 2016. "TL;DR" is short for "too long, didn't read" and indicates that a summary to a given post is given (either written by the author of the post or someone in the comments). The posts can be submissions or comments but only human produced, as bot-posts were filtered out. The original dataset contains 3,848,330 posts of 29'651 subreddits. For each posts the dataset has infromation on the author, the text body (raw and normalized), content, summary, subreddit and subreddit_id.

The dataset was originally intended to train summary-prediciton but it is suitable for our task as well as working with "TL;DR" posts ensures a certain length of the posts which helps with consistent quality of the computed EMI scores and relativizes the influence of single words. 
The fact that bot posts were filtered is also important, as our analysis focuses on the language of humans in specific contexts.

To make the dataload manageable we filtered for the subreddits that contain more than 10'000 posts. We then did a manual selection of subreddits we expected to show either strong evidence-based language or intuition-based language. After an initial inspection we eliminated those, whose mean value of the EMI was closest to zero.

16 subreddits remained in our selection, which meant 615392 posts to analyze. The subreddits are: r/relationships,  r/relationship_advice,  r/explainlikeimfive, r/todayilearned, r/worldnews, r/offmychest, r/buildapc, r/askmen, r/technology, r/dating_advice, r/askscience, r/news, r/talesfromtechsupport, r/depression, r/loseit,
and r/advice.

Processing and analysis happened mostly on the content column and the summary, grouped by subreddit.

#### main analysis - EMI
##### Preprocessing

On the selected subset of the reddit dataset we first applied data cleaning. We converted all words to lowercase, removed punctuation, tokenized the words with the nltk python package word-tokenizer and with the list provided by the nltk package we removed stopwords. The nltk tokenizer is a word tokenizer, currently an improved Treebank-Word-Tokenizer along with Punkt-Sentence-Tokenizer, we used the english version [SOURCE-3]. All preprocessing was applied on the "content" column, in batches of 1000 rows. All further analysis was then done on the cleaned content.

##### EMI of the long posts

According to the paper, the EMI-procedure includes 1. creating a list of keywords for each of the concepts, 2. training a word2vec model on the cleaned tokens and those lists of keywords, 3. calculating the average vector for each of the keyword lists to have an abstract representation of the concepts, 4. then calculating the cosine similarity between this concept-representation vectors and each post, where for each post the average of the word embeddings for its content words is computed. 5. the cosine similarities are binned and normalized and finally the EMI is obtained by subtracting the intuition score form the evidence score.

We followed this approach and the means used by the original authors. For the main analysis we adopted the keyword lists that were used in [Source-1]. Then we used the word2vec algorithm from the Gensim library and trained 300-dimensional vectors based on a context window of 5 words, as Aroyehun et al. did. Next we applied mean pooling of the word embeddings for each post on the keyword lists and the tokenized posts and then computed the cosine similarity between the resulting post average vectors and the concept (evidence /intuition) vectors. We saved these values and further applied length-based binning to account for variations in the length of posts (binning similarities by lengtha and subtracting the mean-similarity within each bin from the cosine simialrity of each instance, see [Source-1]). As a last step before computing the EMI by subtracting the intuition-score from the evidence-score, we z-transformed the cosine similarities (evidence-similarity and intuition-similarity) of each post to obtain those scores. 

If the resulting EMI score is now a positive value, it indicates that evidence-based language is prevalent in a given post, a negative vlaue indicates prevalence of intuition-based rethoric.
